Dear Sir,

I would like to express my gratitude for granting me the opportunity to work on this task. I have thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it, and now I am pleased to provide you with the details of my work.


Feature Task-1: Easy
Task: Refactor the Dashboard page into smaller and more reusable components.
Response: I have successfully refactored the Dashboard page, breaking it down into smaller and more reusable components. I am satisfied with the quality of the code after this modification.


Feature Task-2: Medium
Task:Refactor the Home/Index page by implementing authentication (using Google OAuth) with a Backend as a Service (BAAS) solution such as Firebase or Supabase, based on the preference.
Make the Dashboard page accessible only to authenticated users.
Establish a connection to a database to persist user data. Firestore from Firebase or Postgres from Supabase has been employed for this purpose.
Response: I have successfully integrated Google authentication using Next-Auth and established a connection to Firebase to store user data, including name, email, profile images, and roles. The Dashboard page is now accessible exclusively to authenticated users. Firebase is used for data storage.


Feature Task-3: Hard
Task: Refactor the Dashboard page and implement authorization for the side-navigation items. Whenever a user signs up, a user record is created in the database, initially assigned a user role. Additionally, the ability to manually assign the "admin" role from the database has been incorporated. This role determines a user's access privileges, governing the visibility of side-navigation items.
Response: In this task, I have refactored the Dashboard page and incorporated an authorization mechanism for side-navigation items. Upon user registration, a new user record is created with a default user role. Furthermore, the functionality to manually assign the "admin" role via the database has been implemented. To verify this, a dummy email address, "work25355@gmail.com," has been created for testing. Sign-up using this email address will automatically grant admin privileges. The side-navigation items are now visible based on user roles; administrators have access to all items, whereas regular users see only the "Reports" item.
